=====================

Little trivia quiz app demo for Chromecast, shown at DevFest NL 2014.

## Get it working on your Chromecast
The most important thing is to change the `Application ID` to something that works with your Chromecast.

1. Follow the [steps to register an application](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/registration#RegisterApp)
2. Use `https://avgp.github.io/chromecast-triviatime/receiver.html` as the receiver URL.
3. Take the Application ID you get from step 1.
4. Substitute the `137C3100` (that's my original application ID) in https://github.com/AVGP/chromecast-triviatime/blob/gh-pages/index.html#L66 with your application ID.

Have fun :)
